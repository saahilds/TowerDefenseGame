# To run: import all libraries in MainApplication.java and run the MainApplication method class. 
# This is a tower defense video game that uses the JavaFX and FXML libraries. We allow players to build different types of towers with varying costs, damage levels, and damage radii. The only factor limiting tower construction is money, which varies based on difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard) and increases linearly over time. 
# There are different types of enemies that do varying levels of damage to our towers. 
# After defeating all main stream enemies, users will have to defeat a Final Boss to win the game. All relevant stats are reported at the end of the game.
